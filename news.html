                    <h3>Suryakumar To Leave Mumbai Indians For KKR Captaincy In IPL 2025?!</h3>
                    <p>New Delhi: After reports of Yuvraj Singh in talks with Delhi Capitals emerged on Sunday, a viral social media claim has put the newsmakers in dilemma ahead of the IPL 2025 retention policy announcement. According to the claim, three-time IPL champions Kolkata Knight Riders have approached Suryakumar Yadav for captaincy for the upcoming season.

                        Suryakumar, who has played for Kolkata Knight Riders for a few seasons before, had joined Mumbai Indians in 2018. One of the most destructive T20 players in the current era, Suryakumar has been a pillar for Mumbai Indians for the past seven years.
                        Based on the viral claim, KKR will trade their IPL 2024 title-winning captain Shreyas Iyer to Mumbai Indians in return for Suryakumar. But the biggest question at the moment is will KKR let go of their IPL-winning captain?
                        
                        The Shah Rukh Khan co-owned franchise can’t trade Iyer to Mumbai Indians for Suryakumar before the IPL 2025 mega auction as there are no trading windows available. In that case, Suryakumar has to leave Mumbai Indians and enter the auction even if KKR have made him an offer beforehand.
                        
                        However, things will be difficult for KKR in the mega auction as far as Suryakumar is concerned since almost all the teams will throw their hats to sign the Indian T20I captain. Meanwhile, the BCCI recently met with the IPL owners to discuss the road ahead. Despite a few franchises were against the mega auction, the board is likely to stage it. The franchises are likely to retain 4-6 players with the Right To Match (RTM) card making a return.</p>

                        Lucknow Super Giants are set to appoint former India speedster Zaheer Khan as their mentor ahead of the IPL mega auction. The appointment marks the return of the 45-year-old left-arm pacer to the IPL fold after two years, having been associated with five-time champions Mumbai Indians from 2018-2022. A formal unveiling is scheduled at the RPSG Group Headquarters in Kolkata on Wednesday. "Zaheer has been appointed as team mentor and the unveiling will happen later today," sources told PTI..</p>
                        <p> Zaheer will thus take up the role left vacant by Gautam Gambhir last year when he went to join his former franchise Kolkata Knight Riders and guided them to the IPL title in 2024. Gambhir is now the Indian head coach.

                            At Mumbai Indians, Zaheer first served as the director of cricket before taking on the role of head of global development.
                            
                            LSG currently do not have a bowling coach after the departure of South African speedster Morne Morkel, who has joined Gambhir's coaching staff.
                            
                            It is learnt that Zaheer will also be involved in scouting and player-development programme during the off season.</p>
